[36msshkey-list[0m (also 'sshkeys', 'list-sshkey', 'sshkey list')
----------------------------------------------------------
OpenShift uses public keys to securely access your application source code and
to control access to your application gears via SSH.  Your account may have one
or more public SSH keys associated with it, and any computer with the private
SSH key will be able to download code from Git or SSH to the application.

Depending on your operating system, you may have to ensure that both Git and the
local SSH installation have access to your keys.  Running the 'setup' command is
any easy way to get your first key created and uploaded.

[36mmember-list[0m (also 'members', 'list-member', 'member list')
----------------------------------------------------------
Show the existing members of a domain, application, or team.

To show the members of a domain or application, you can pass the name of your
domain with '-n', the name of your application with '-a', or combine them in the
first argument to the command like:
  rhc members <domain_name>[/<app_name>]

To show the members of a team, you can pass the name of the team with '-t':
  rhc members -t TEAM_NAME

The owner is always listed first.  To see the unique ID of members, pass
'--ids'.

[36menv-list[0m (also 'envs', 'list-env', 'env list')
----------------------------------------------

[36mcartridge-list[0m
  (also 'app cartridge list', 'app-cartridge-list', 'cartridges',
  'list-cartridge', 'cartridge list')
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cartridges add functionality to OpenShift applications.  Each application has
one web cartridge to listen for HTTP requests, and any number of addon
cartridges.  Addons may include databases like MySQL and Mongo, administrative
tools like phpMyAdmin, or build clients like Jenkins.

Most cartridges that listen for incoming network traffic are placed on one or
more gears (a small server instance).  Other cartridges may be available across
all of the gears of an application to listen for changes (like Jenkins) or
provide environment variables.

Use the 'cartridges' command to see a list of all available cartridges. Add a
new cartridge to your application with 'add-cartridge'. OpenShift also supports
downloading cartridges - pass a URL in place of the cartridge name and we'll
download and install that cartridge into your app.  Keep in mind that these
cartridges receive no security updates.  Note that not all OpenShift servers
allow downloaded cartridges.

For scalable applications, use the 'cartridge-scale' command on the web
cartridge to set the minimum and maximum scale.

Commands that affect a cartridge within an application will affect all gears the
cartridge is installed to.

[36mauthorization-list[0m
  (also 'authorizations', 'list-authorization', 'authorization list')
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows the full list of authorization tokens on your account. You can add, edit,
or delete authorizations with subcommands.

An authorization token grants access to the OpenShift REST API with a set of
privileges called 'scopes' for a limited time.  You can add an optional note to
each authorization token to assist you in remembering what is available.

[36malias-list[0m (also 'aliases', 'list-alias', 'alias list')
-------------------------------------------------------
